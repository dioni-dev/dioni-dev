## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello, I'm Dionisio, a Cloud-native Platform Engineer with a passion for building and managing scalable and reliable infrastructures. With a solid foundation in Python, Java, and Golang, I specialize in tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Jenkins, Git, Terraform, and Ansible, and have experience across AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud platforms.

I love learning new technologies and collaborating on exciting projects. I'm always looking for ways to improve and grow both in my career and personal development. Over the years, I've learned that effective communication, teamwork, and the ability to adapt to change are just as important as the technical skills themselves.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the latest open-source technology, reading about emerging trends in the cloud industry, and contributing to various open-source projects. I'm also an avid reader and love spending time outdoors, whether it's hiking, running, or simply enjoying nature.
